This is a simple mod for Cities: Skylines that prevents edge 
scrolling from triggering when the mouse leaves the game window.

# Known problems:

- Changing the setting triggers writing the settings file to disk.
- It's hard to use edge scrolling due to the small hotzone. This 
doesn't seem to be adjustable. (The sensitivity setting only 
changes speed, not range.)
